Hi, I’m Marc. I’m a freelance Software Engineer and I’m passionate about the creation of cloud-native software systems.

My current focus is on Kotlin / Java / Spring backend applications, leveraging Kubernetes and the cloud native 
ecosystem as runtime environment, but I also enjoy creating web applications with React or Angular.
