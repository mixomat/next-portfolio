      <p>Hi, I’m Marc. I’m a freelance Software Engineer and I’m passionate about designing and implementing cloud-native software systems.</p>
      <p>With many years of experience, working on a huge breadth of projects from user-facing web apps, big data processing platforms, messaging backend systems, and more, I truly believe in agile software development methods and DevOps culture.</p>
      <p>I support agile teams adopting that same mindset and take responsibility for the software architecture, requirement analysis, feature implementation, code quality coaching and infrastructure / operations tasks.</p>
      <p>My current focus is on Kotlin / Java / Spring backend applications, leveraging Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem as runtime environment, but I’m also having extensive knowledge in frontend application development with Angular / React.</p>
